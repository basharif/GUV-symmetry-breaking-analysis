# GUV-symmetry-breaking-analysis
This repository contains the code used for symmetry breaking analysis of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) in the article:

DOI:   

Code 1 generates masks to segment GUVs. 

Code 2 generate kymographs for biochemical properties (membrane  marker, ActA, and actin signal) and physical properties (curvature and eccentricity) of GUVs.

Code 3 applies correlation analysis and principal component analysis to study symmetry breaking. 

Additional details regarding the approaches used can be found in the Supplementary Information section of the paper.
